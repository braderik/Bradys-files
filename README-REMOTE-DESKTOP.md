## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### On Your Mac (One-Time Setup)

1. **Download this repository to your Mac:**
   ```bash
   # If you have git:
   git clone https://github.com/braderik/Bradys-files.git ~/Bradys-files

   # Or download ZIP and extract to ~/Bradys-files
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Bradys-files
   chmod +x scripts/setup-mac-host.sh scripts/launch-ai-desktop.sh
   ./scripts/setup-mac-host.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Verify Chrome Remote Desktop is installed (prompts to install if missing)
   - Configure power management (prevent sleep on AC power)
   - Set up auto-launch of ChatGPT and Claude tabs at login

3. **Set up Chrome Remote Desktop:**
   - Open Chrome on your Mac
   - Go to: https://remotedesktop.google.com/access
   - Click "Set up Remote Access" → Download and install
   - Name your Mac (e.g., "Home-Mac-AI")
   - Create a strong PIN (8+ digits) and save it in your password manager

4. **Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification
   - Follow the setup wizard
   - **Save backup codes securely!**

### On Your Windows Work PC (Every Time You Connect)

1. Open browser → https://remotedesktop.google.com/access
2. Sign in with the same Google Account
3. Click your Mac device → Enter PIN
4. ChatGPT and Claude tabs should already be open and ready!

**That's it!** You're now controlling your Mac and can use ChatGPT/Claude as if you were sitting at your Mac.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Mac not appearing in Remote Devices list
1. Verify Mac is powered on and connected to internet
2. Check System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items for "ChromeRemoteDesktopHost"
3. Ensure you're signed into the same Google Account on both devices

### Poor performance / lag
1. Test network speed: https://fast.com (Mac should have 5+ Mbps upload)
2. Close unnecessary apps on Mac (Activity Monitor → CPU/Memory)
3. Reduce quality in CRD options (⚙️ icon → move slider toward "Faster")

### "PIN is incorrect" error
1. Verify PIN in your password manager
2. If forgotten: Remove device from CRD settings and re-add with new PIN

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is this allowed by my employer?
**A:** Chrome Remote Desktop is a Google product commonly used in enterprise environments. However, verify with your IT policy regarding personal remote desktop usage. This setup does NOT transfer corporate data to your personal Mac.

### Q: Can I use this to access other applications besides ChatGPT/Claude?
**A:** Yes! CRD gives full control of your Mac. However, this repository is optimized for AI tool access. Avoid accessing corporate systems on your personal Mac.

### Q: What if my Mac goes to sleep?
**A:** The `setup-mac-host.sh` script disables system sleep on AC power. Ensure your Mac stays plugged in during work hours. Alternatively, use a smart plug or Wake-on-LAN.

### Q: How secure is this?
**A:** Very secure. CRD uses end-to-end AES-256 encryption, requires Google Account 2SV, and a separate PIN for Mac access. No ports are opened on your Mac. See [Security Checklist](docs/security-checklist.md) for full details.

### Q: Can I upload files from my Windows PC to ChatGPT/Claude?
**A:** Not directly. Files must be on the Mac's filesystem. Workaround: Upload files from Windows to Google Drive/Dropbox, then download to Mac via CRD.

### Q: Does this use APIs?
**A:** No. This setup uses the ChatGPT and Claude **web interfaces** (browser-based). No API keys or coding required.

### Q: What happens to my conversations?
**A:** Conversations are stored by OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Anthropic (Claude) on their servers, subject to their privacy policies. CRD does not log conversation content (only transmits screen pixels).
